# Starknet Smart Contracts

A Starknet contract can be created by annotating a Cairo module with the `#[contract]` attribute

Starknet contract don't require a `main` function.
Functions in the contract module may be annotated as a `#[view]` or an `#[external]` function. External/View functions can be called by the users of Starknet, and by other contracts. The functions without these annotations are internal and cannot be accessed by users nor by other contract.

## Contract annotations

Here are the attributes/decorators available to annotate smart contracts.

| Annotation       | Target     | Description                                     |
| ---------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `#[contract]`    | `module`   | Marks a module as a contract                    |
| `#[constructor]` | `function` | Contract constructor, runs (only) on deployment |
| `#[view]`        | `function` | An endpoint that doesn't modify state           |
| `#[external]`    | `function` | An endpoint that modifies state                 |

## Storage

Contract storage is represented as a `struct` with name `Storage`.

```rust
struct Storage {
	store: felt252, // Can be any type

	// A u32 mapping to a bool
	mapped: LegacyMap::<u32, bool>,

	// Use `tuple`s to have multiple values mapping
	// Here a `ContractAddress` and a `u32` mapping to a Job struct
	multi_map: LegacyMap::<(ContractAddress, u32), Job>,
}
```

The keys of the struct are made into their own modules, these modules have `read` and `write` functions.

```rust
#[external]
fn play {
	store::write( 592 );
	let value = store::read(); // 592
}
```

`LegacyMap` types require a parameter with type matching the first generic type of the map when `read`/`write`.

```rust
#[external]
fn play {
	mapped::write( 83_u32, true );
	let value = multi_map::read( 83_u32 ); // true
}
```

## `ContractAddress` type

`ContractAddress` type is a semantic type for wallet/contract addresses.

```rust
use starknet::ContractAddress;
use traits::TryInto; // Base TryInto trait
use starknet::Felt252TryIntoContractAddress; // felt > ContractAddress impl
use starknet::contract_address_to_felt252;
use option::OptionTrait; // To unwrap
use starknet::get_caller_address; // Gets caller address

use debug::PrintTrait; // Just for printing
#[test]
#[available_gas(2000000000)]
fn play() {
	let owner_felt: felt252 = 0x0390595E0f30299328F610C689fcFf5B0ee48eE971f0742b5568e5Dd1DE6e324;

	// Felt to ContractAddress
	let owner_addr: ContractAddress = owner_felt.try_into().unwrap();
	owner_addr.print();

	let caller = get_caller_address();
	// ContractAddress to Felt
	let owner_felt: felt252 = contract_address_to_felt252(caller);
	owner_felt.print();
}
```
